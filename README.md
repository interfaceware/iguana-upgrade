<h1>Iguana Configuration Utility</h1>

It's a channel which can be used to upgrade an Iguana 6.0.X version to a newer Iguana 6.0.X 
version and also roll back to an earlier 6.0.X version.  The utility is supported on Linux and Windows in 32 and 64 bits flavours.

We recommend that you try this utility on a development or test server to verify that it is compatible with your environment before trying it within a production context.

See http://help.interfaceware.com/v6/iguana-configuration-utility for the complete documentation.
